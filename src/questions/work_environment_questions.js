        answer: "D",
        explain: "Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs): These are gases emitted from certain solids or liquids, such as paints, cleaning products, fuels, and solvents. Continuous monitoring of VOCs is necessary to detect any potential buildup of harmful or toxic gases, as high concentrations can lead to health issues and safety hazards.\n\nOxygen: The presence of sufficient oxygen is crucial for humans to breathe. In a confined space, oxygen levels can decrease due to various reasons, including the consumption of oxygen by chemical reactions, displacement by other gases, or oxygen depletion caused by combustion or oxidation processes. Continuous monitoring of oxygen levels ensures that the space remains safe and breathable.\n\nFlammable Vapors: Confined spaces can sometimes contain flammable substances or materials that can produce flammable vapors. Monitoring for flammable vapors is essential to detect any dangerous buildup that could potentially lead to explosions or fires. This is particularly important in environments where there is a risk of ignition sources, such as sparks or open flames."

        answer: "C",
        explain: 'A multiple gas monitor is a device that is used to measure the concentration of various gases in a confined space. The most common gases that are measured in a confined space include oxygen (O\u2082), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen sulfide (H\u2082S), and the lower explosive limit (LEL) of flammable gases. Oxygen levels must be monitored to ensure that there is enough oxygen for workers to breathe, while carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide are toxic gases that can cause serious health effects at high concentrations.\n\nThe Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) is the lowest concentration of a flammable gas or vapor in the air that is capable of producing a flash of fire when an ignition source (such as a spark or flame) is present. The LEL is expressed as a percentage of the gas or vapor in the air by volume.\n\nFor example, the LEL of methane gas is 5% by volume. This means that if the concentration of methane in the air is below 5%, it is too lean to burn and will not ignite, even in the presence of an ignition source. However, if the concentration of methane in the air is above 5%, it can ignite and cause an explosion if an ignition source is present.'

        ],
        answer: "C",
        explain: 'Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that can be produced by incomplete combustion of fuels such as natural gas, propane, gasoline, oil, and wood. It is highly toxic to humans and animals, as it binds to hemoglobin in the blood more readily than oxygen, reducing the amount of oxygen that can be transported to the tissues of body.\n\nExposure to high levels of CO can cause symptoms such as headache, dizziness, nausea, confusion, weakness, and even loss of consciousness and death.CO poisoning is a serious health risk, and it can occur in a variety of settings, including homes, offices, and industrial sites.\n\nOne of the challenges with CO is that it is not easily detectable by human senses, as it has no color, taste, or odor. Therefore, it is important to have CO detectors installed in buildings where there is a potential for CO exposure, such as those with fuel - burning appliances or attached garages.\n\nCommon sources of carbon monoxide (CO) in homes include gas appliances (furnaces, stoves), fireplaces, generators, automobiles in attached garages, blocked chimneys/vents, grills indoors, malfunctioning appliances, gas-powered tools indoors, and attached garages.'
