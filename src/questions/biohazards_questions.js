Disinfection is typically used in settings such as hospitals, laboratories, and food processing plants to prevent the spread of infectious agents. Disinfectants can include chemicals such as bleach, hydrogen peroxide, and alcohol, as well as ultraviolet radiation and other physical or chemical agents. \n\nIn comparison, cleaning focuses on the physical removal of dirt and debris, whereas disinfecting aims to kill or inactivate microorganisms on surfaces. Cleaning is an essential first step because it removes organic matter that can harbor and protect microorganisms. Disinfecting follows cleaning to further reduce the microbial load and minimize the risk of infection. It's important to note that not all cleaning products have disinfecting properties, and vice versa. Some products may serve both purposes and are known as 'cleaners and disinfectants' or 'disinfectant cleaners'."

        explain: "The characteristic that distinguishes viruses from bacteria and fungi is their dependence on a host cell for replication. Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, meaning they cannot reproduce or carry out their life cycle independently. Instead, they must infect a host cell and hijack its cellular machinery to replicate and produce new viral particles.\n\nIn contrast, bacteria and fungi are independent organisms that can reproduce and carry out their life processes autonomously. Bacteria are single-celled organisms with a cell membrane, cell wall, and genetic material (DNA or RNA) contained within their cell. Fungi can be single-celled (yeasts) or multicellular (molds and mushrooms) and have a distinct cellular structure with a cell wall, nucleus, and other cellular organelles.\n\nOption A (Ability to reproduce independently) and Option B (Presence of a cell membrane) are characteristics shared by bacteria and fungi but not by viruses.\n\nOption C (Composition of genetic material) is partly true, as all three, viruses, bacteria, and fungi, can have either DNA or RNA as their genetic material.

It includes physical barriers such as the skin and mucous membranes, as well as immune cells like phagocytes and natural killer cells. Innate immunity provides a rapid response to any foreign invader, but it is not specific to particular pathogens.\n\nB) Adaptive immunity: This is a type of immunity that is acquired over time as the body is exposed to different pathogens. Adaptive immunity is specific to particular pathogens and involves the production of antibodies and the activation of T cells. Once the body has been exposed to a pathogen, it will 'remember' it and be able to mount a faster and stronger response if it is encountered again in the future.\n\nC) Passive immunity: This type of immunity is acquired through the transfer of antibodies from one individual to another. It can occur naturally, such as from a mother to her baby during breastfeeding, or artificially, such as through the administration of antibodies to treat or prevent a particular infection. Passive immunity provides immediate protection but is temporary, as the transferred antibodies eventually break down and are eliminated from the body."

            "D. Bronchial constriction"
        ],
        answer: "A",
        explain: "Mucus production is the primary defense mechanism of the respiratory system that helps to protect against airborne pathogens and foreign particles. The respiratory tract is lined with mucus-secreting cells that produce a sticky mucus layer. This mucus acts as a physical barrier, trapping inhaled particles such as dust, bacteria, and viruses. The cilia lining the respiratory tract then move the mucus with trapped particles out of the airways through coordinated sweeping motions, helping to remove the pathogens and foreign particles from the lungs.\n\nThe coughing reflex is another important defense mechanism of the respiratory system. When foreign particles or pathogens are trapped in mucus, the coughing reflex helps to expel them from the lungs.\n\nAlveolar macrophages are cells that are found in the alveoli, which are the tiny sacs at the end of the bronchioles in the lungs. Alveolar macrophages help to remove foreign particles and pathogens from the alveoli.\n\nBronchial constriction is a narrowing of the airways that can occur in response to irritants or allergens. Bronchial constriction can make it difficult to breathe, but it is not a primary defense mechanism of the respiratory system."

            "D. By producing mucosal barriers"
        ],
        answer: "C",
        explain: "Alveolar macrophages are specialized cells that are found in the lungs. They are responsible for removing pathogens and foreign particles from the lungs. They do this by engulfing the pathogens or foreign particles through a process called phagocytosis.\n\nPhagocytosis is a process by which cells engulf and digest other cells or particles. Alveolar macrophages use phagocytosis to engulf pathogens or foreign particles by extending pseudopods, or finger-like projections, around the particle. Once the particle is engulfed, it is enclosed in a vesicle called a phagosome. The phagosome then fuses with a lysosome, which contains enzymes that digest the particle.\n\nThe digested particles are then broken down into small molecules that can be eliminated from the body. This process helps to protect the lungs from infection and disease."
