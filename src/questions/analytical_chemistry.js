        answer: 'A',
        explain: 'Gas Chromatography (GC) is a separation technique used to separate and analyze individual components of a mixture. It involves the vaporization of a sample and its injection into a chromatographic column, which is typically coated with a stationary phase. The sample is carried through the column by a carrier gas, and as it passes through the column, different components of the sample interact with the stationary phase to different extents. This interaction causes the components to separate based on their physical and chemical properties, such as volatility and affinity for the stationary phase. As a result, the components elute from the column at different times, allowing for their separation.\n\nMass Spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to determine the molecular composition and structure of chemical compounds. It involves the ionization of molecules in a sample, the separation of ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), and the detection of these ions. In MS, the ionized molecules are accelerated through an electric field and directed into a mass analyzer, which separates the ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio. The separated ions are then detected, and a mass spectrum is generated, which represents the abundance of ions at different m/z values. The mass spectrum can provide information about the molecular weight, fragmentation pattern, and chemical structure of the compounds present in the sample.'

        explain: "During a titration, a small volume of the titrant is incrementally added to the sample containing the analyte. The titrant is usually added from a burette, which allows precise control over the volume of titrant added. The reaction between the analyte and titrant is typically monitored using an indicator or by measuring a physical property such as pH or conductivity.\n\nThe titration reaction occurs in a stoichiometric ratio, meaning that there is a specific mole-to-mole ratio between the analyte and titrant. This ratio allows for the determination of the analyte's concentration based on the volume of titrant required to reach a specific endpoint or equivalence point. The endpoint is the point at which a specific color change occurs or a specific signal is observed, indicating that the reaction is complete. The equivalence point is the theoretical point at which the analyte and titrant have reacted in exact stoichiometric proportions.\n\nBy carefully measuring the volume of titrant required to reach the endpoint or equivalence point, and knowing the concentration of the titrant, one can calculate the concentration of the analyte using the principles of stoichiometry.\n\nSpectrophotometry, is a widely used technique in chemical analysis, but it does not involve the reaction of an analyte with a known reagent in a controlled reaction to determine its concentration. Spectrophotometry involves the measurement of the absorption or transmission of light by a sample at specific wavelengths. It is based on the principle that different compounds absorb or transmit light at different wavelengths due to their specific molecular properties. By measuring the amount of light absorbed or transmitted by a sample, the concentration of a specific compound can be determined using a calibration curve or Beer-Lambert law."

In this technique, the analytes of interest are selectively extracted from the sample matrix into an immiscible organic solvent. The extraction process is based on the differential solubility of the analytes between the aqueous sample and the organic solvent. After extraction, the organic solvent phase containing the analytes is separated, concentrated if necessary, and then injected into the GC-MS system for analysis.\n\nSolid-phase microextraction (A) is another sample preparation technique used in various analytical methods, including GC-MS.
