They contain a solid adsorbent material, such as activated charcoal or a polymer resin, which can trap and retain the volatile compounds present in the air. The sampling process involves drawing a known volume of air through the sorbent tube, allowing the VOCs to adsorb onto the sorbent material.\n\nPassive samplers can indeed be a suitable option for collecting air samples for volatile organic compound (VOC) analysis, depending on the specific requirements of the sampling scenario. However, passive samplers may have limitations in terms of the range of compounds they can effectively capture and may be more suitable for specific classes of VOCs.\n\nIn addition, Sorbent tubes are typically used for shorter sampling durations, ranging from minutes to several hours. They are commonly used for grab sampling or short-term monitoring. On the other hand, passive samplers are designed for longer sampling durations, ranging from days to weeks or even months.\n\nOption C, impingers, are often used for the collection of airborne particles or gases, but they are not commonly used as the primary media for VOC sampling. Impingers are typically used for collecting liquid or water-soluble compounds rather than VOCs."

        answer: "C",
        explain: "A passive sampler (option B) is not the ideal choice for SO\u2082 analysis. While passive samplers are useful for integrating pollutant levels over a longer period of time, they may not provide the desired sensitivity for gaseous pollutants like SO\u2082. Passive samplers are typically more suitable for collecting volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or other similar contaminants.\n\nA high-volume sampler (option D) is capable of collecting a large volume of air, but it may not be the most appropriate option for SO\u2082 analysis. SO\u2082 concentrations are typically measured in parts per million (ppm) or parts per billion (ppb), and a high-volume sampler may not be necessary for adequate detection and analysis of SO\u2082.\n\nAn impinger sampler (option C) is well-suited for collecting air samples for SO\u2082 analysis. Impinger samplers are commonly used for collecting gases and vapors. They utilize a liquid (such as a reagent solution) to trap the gas of interest, in this case, SO\u2082. The liquid in the impinger reacts with the SO\u2082, capturing and retaining it for subsequent analysis. Impinger samplers are known for their sensitivity to gaseous pollutants and are frequently used for gas sampling and analysis."

        answer: "A",
        explain: "The purpose of a cyclone separator when used in air sampling is to remove particles larger than 10 microns. Cyclone separators work by creating a vortex that causes larger particles to separate from the air stream and collect in a reservoir. \n\nThe remaining air stream, which is now depleted of larger particles, can then be directed to a filter or other sampling media for further analysis. This helps to ensure that only particles of a certain size range are collected, which can be important for certain types of air sampling applications. Cyclone separators are often used in conjunction with other sampling methods to provide more comprehensive analysis of airborne contaminants."

In gas chromatography, the detector response is typically measured as a peak area or peak height, and it is related to the quantity of a specific compound present in the sample.\n\nTo create a calibration curve, a series of standard gas samples with known concentrations of specific compounds are prepared and analyzed using the gas chromatograph. The instrument records the detector response for each standard. By plotting the detector responses against the corresponding known concentrations, a calibration curve is generated.\n\nThe calibration curve represents the relationship between the detector response and the concentration of the compounds of interest. In other words, it shows how the gas chromatograph responds to different concentrations of the standard compounds."

The term "isokinetic" refers to the fact that the sampling velocity is maintained equal to the gas stream velocity, ensuring that the sample is representative of the gas stream at the point of sampling.\n\nIf the sampling velocity is less than the exhaust stream velocity, it will result in oversampling of large particles because large particles can still go to the tube due to inertia and the small particles will not be sampled. \n\nOn the other end, if the sampling velocity is more than the exhaust stream velocity, it will result in oversampling of small particles.'
