        name: 'Dilution Ventilation',
        description: 'Dilution ventilation is a method of ventilation that involves introducing fresh air into a space to dilute and reduce the concentration of contaminants. It is commonly used in large open areas or spaces with low-level contamination.'
    },
    {
        name: 'Local Exhaust Ventilation (LEV)',
        description: 'Local exhaust ventilation is a ventilation system that captures and removes contaminants at their source before they disperse into the surrounding air. It typically includes hoods, ductwork, and exhaust fans, effectively controlling and preventing the spread of contaminants.'
    },
    {
        name: 'Make-Up Air',
        description: 'Make-up air is fresh air that is supplied to a space to replace air that has been removed or exhausted. It ensures proper ventilation and prevents negative pressure within the space.'
    },
    {
        name: 'Exhaust Air',
        description: 'Exhaust air is the air that is removed from a space by ventilation systems. It typically contains contaminants, odors, or excess heat and is expelled to the outside environment.'
    },
    {
        name: 'Recirculation',
        description: 'Recirculation involves reusing a portion of the air that has been exhausted from a space. It is commonly used in systems with energy recovery devices to improve energy efficiency while maintaining adequate ventilation.'
    },
    {
        name: 'Air Cleaning Technologies',
        description: 'Air cleaning technologies, such as filters, electrostatic precipitators, and UV germicidal irradiation, are used to remove contaminants from the air and improve indoor air quality. They are often integrated into ventilation systems to enhance filtration and purification.'
    },
    {
        name: 'Negative Pressure Room',
        description: 'A negative pressure room is a specialized isolation room designed to maintain lower air pressure compared to surrounding areas. It is commonly used in healthcare settings to prevent the spread of airborne infectious diseases, ensuring that contaminated air flows into the room rather than escaping.'
    },
    {
        name: 'Positive Pressure Room',
        description: 'A positive pressure room is an isolation room designed to maintain higher air pressure compared to surrounding areas. It is used in environments where protection from external contamination is crucial, such as cleanrooms or critical manufacturing processes.'
    },
    {
        name: 'Ventilation for Laboratories',
        description: 'Laboratory ventilation systems are designed to control and remove hazardous substances, fumes, and particles generated during laboratory procedures. They incorporate fume hoods, exhaust systems, and containment strategies to protect laboratory personnel and maintain a safe working environment.'
    },
    {
        name: 'Ventilation for Confined Spaces',
        description: 'Ventilation in confined spaces, such as tanks, tunnels, or underground structures, is critical for ensuring a safe working environment. Proper ventilation systems help control the buildup of hazardous gases, provide fresh air supply, and prevent asphyxiation or toxic exposures.'
    },
    {
        name: 'Ventilation for Industrial Processes',
        description: 'Ventilation systems for industrial processes are designed to control air pollutants, heat, and humidity generated during manufacturing or industrial operations. These systems protect workers, ensure product quality, and comply with environmental regulations.'
