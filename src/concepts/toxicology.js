        name: "Toxicity",
        description: "Toxicity is the study of adverse effects caused by chemical, physical, or biological agents on living organisms. It examines how substances can harm the human body, including their mechanisms of action, dose-response relationships, and the factors that influence their toxicity."
    },
    {
        name: "Routes of exposure",
        description: "Routes of exposure refer to the pathways through which a substance can enter the body. Common routes include inhalation (breathing in airborne substances), ingestion (swallowing substances), and dermal contact (absorption through the skin)."
    },
    {
        name: "Toxicokinetics",
        description: "Toxicokinetics refers to the study of how substances are absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted in the body. It helps determine the fate of substances in the body and how their concentration changes over time."
    },
    {
        name: "Dose-response relationship",
        description: "The dose-response relationship describes the relationship between the amount of exposure to a substance and the resulting health effects. It helps to determine the relationship between the level of exposure and the severity or likelihood of adverse effects."
    },
    {
        name: "Biological monitoring",
        description: "Biological monitoring involves the measurement and analysis of hazardous substances or their metabolites in biological samples, such as blood, urine, or hair. It helps assess the actual exposure levels and the uptake or accumulation of substances in the body."
    },
    {
        name: "Bioaccumulation",
        description: "Bioaccumulation is the process by which substances accumulate in the tissues of living organisms over time. It occurs when an organism absorbs a substance at a rate faster than it can eliminate it, resulting in an increase in concentration within its body."
    },
    {
        name: "Biomagnification",
        description: "Biomagnification refers to the process by which the concentration of a substance increases at higher levels of the food chain. It occurs when organisms at lower trophic levels consume contaminated organisms, leading to the progressive amplification of the substance's concentration."
    },
    {
        name: "Bioavailability",
        description: "Bioavailability is the extent to which a substance is absorbed and becomes available in the body after exposure. It depends on factors such as the route of exposure, chemical form, solubility, and the ability to cross biological barriers."
    },
    {
        name: "Carcinogenicity",
        description: "Carcinogenicity is the ability of a substance to cause cancer. Certain substances, known as carcinogens, can induce or promote the development of cancer cells in the body."
    },
    {
        name: "Mutagenicity",
        description: "Mutagenicity refers to the ability of a substance to cause genetic mutations. Mutagens can alter the DNA structure, leading to changes in the genetic material of an organism, which can result in hereditary disorders or the development of cancer."
