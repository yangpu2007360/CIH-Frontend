        name: "Definition of noise",
        description: "Noise is any unwanted or disruptive sound, signal, or disturbance that interferes with desired information or communication. It can be subjective and vary based on perception and context."
    },
    {
        name: "Types of noise",
        description: "Various types of noise include thermal noise, white noise, Gaussian noise, impulse noise, and environmental noise. Each type has distinct characteristics and sources."
    },
    {
        name: "Frequency spectrum",
        description: "The frequency spectrum refers to the range of frequencies at which noise occurs. Understanding the spectrum helps analyze and address specific types of noise interference."

    {
        name: "Decibel (dB)",
        description: "The decibel is a logarithmic unit used to measure the intensity or power of sound. It provides a convenient way to express noise levels and compare relative noise intensities."

    {
        name: "Noise reduction techniques",
        description: "Techniques such as sound insulation, noise barriers, active noise cancellation (ANC), and noise filtering can be employed to reduce or mitigate noise in different settings."
    },
    {
        name: "Background noise",
        description: "Background noise refers to ambient or constant noise present in a particular environment, which can include sounds from machinery, ventilation systems, or general activity."

    {
        name: "Occupational noise exposure",
        description: "Occupational noise exposure refers to the level of noise that workers are exposed to in their workplace. Managing occupational noise is important for worker safety and health."
    },
    {
        name: "Temporary threshold shift (TTS)",
        description: "Temporary threshold shift is a temporary hearing loss experienced after exposure to high noise levels. It can recover over time with reduced noise exposure."
    },
    {
        name: "Permanent threshold shift (PTS)",
        description: "Permanent threshold shift is a permanent hearing loss resulting from prolonged or repeated exposure to high noise levels. It is typically associated with inner ear damage."
    },
    {
        name: "Hearing conservation programs",
        description: "Hearing conservation programs aim to prevent hearing loss among workers exposed to noise. They include monitoring, testing, control measures, education, and hearing protection."

    {
        name: "Noise dosimeter",
        description: "A noise dosimeter is a device worn to measure and record personal noise exposure over time. It provides information about an individual's cumulative noise dose."
    },
    {
        name: "Sound pressure level (SPL)",
        description: "Sound pressure level is a measure of the instantaneous pressure of a sound wave, expressed in decibels. It quantifies and compares the intensity of different sounds."

    {
        name: "Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL)",
        description: "Noise-induced hearing loss is caused by excessive or prolonged noise exposure. It is preventable through proper noise control measures and is a common form of hearing loss."
    },
    {
        name: "Definition of hearing loss",
        description: "Hearing loss refers to partial or complete impairment of the ability to hear sounds. It can range from mild to profound and affects speech perception and sound understanding."
    },
    {
        name: "Types of hearing loss",
        description: "Hearing loss can be conductive, sensorineural, or mixed. Conductive loss involves sound not reaching the inner ear, sensorineural loss is due to inner ear or nerve damage, and mixed loss combines both."
    },
    {
        name: "Causes of hearing loss",
        description: "Hearing loss can be caused by age-related factors, exposure to loud noise, genetic conditions, infections, medications, head trauma, and diseases such as otosclerosis and Meniere's disease."
    },
    {
        name: "Audiogram",
        description: "An audiogram is a graph that displays a person's hearing thresholds at different frequencies. It helps determine the degree and configuration of hearing loss through a hearing test."
