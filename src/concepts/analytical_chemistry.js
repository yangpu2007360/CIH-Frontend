        name: "Stationary Phase",
        description: "The stationary phase is a material that is immobile or fixed in a chromatographic system. It can be a solid (such as a column packing material) or a liquid (such as a thin layer on a plate). The analytes interact with the stationary phase, leading to their separation based on their chemical or physical properties."

        name: "Mobile Phase",
        description: "The mobile phase is a fluid that carries the analytes through the chromatographic system. It can be a liquid (liquid chromatography) or a gas (gas chromatography). The mobile phase's composition and flow rate are carefully selected to optimize separation and elution of the analytes."
